## Challenge 1

## Challenge Name
**Rolls Royce Resource Adjustment Challenge**

**Summary**

Efficient project execution hinges on maintaining accurate and feasible schedules. However,
unexpected changes in resource availability often disrupt timelines, leading to delays,
overutilisation, or underutilisation of resources.
This challenge seeks to develop a tool that dynamically adjusts project activity durations
based on real-time resource data, recalculates critical paths, and highlights changes in
schedule impact. The tool aims to support project managers in ensuring optimal resource
allocation and maintaining schedule feasibility.

**Pain Points**

Schedule Misalignment: Schedules often fail to reflect real-time changes in resource
availability.
Resource Inefficiency: Over or underutilising resources leads to missed deadlines or idle
time.
Manual Adjustments: Current systems require extensive manual intervention for
rescheduling, increasing the risk of errors.
Limited Impact Visibility: Lack of tools to compare original schedules with updated ones
hinders effective decision-making.

**Personas**

As a Project Manager, I want to quickly adapt schedules in response to real-time changes in
resource availability, so that I can maintain project milestones and minimise disruptions. As a
Resource Manager, I want to optimise resource allocation across multiple projects, so that I
can prevent overallocation, avoid inefficiencies, and ensure resource balance.As a
Stakeholder, I want clear and timely visibility into schedule adjustments, so that I can
approve or revise resource distribution strategies with confidence.

**Business Context**

Project timelines can quickly become unfeasible in an environment of fluctuating resource availability.
The ability to dynamically adapt schedules ensures that projects stay on track and resources are
efficiently utilised. Providing stakeholders with clear insights into schedule adjustments builds
confidence and supports timely corrective actions.
Dataset Description
Participants will be provided with a collection of spreadsheets detailing various resource availability
scenarios to simulate real-world fluctuations. Additionally, an XER file from Primavera P6 will be
included, representing the original project schedule, to serve as a baseline for comparisons and
adjustments.

**Success Criteria**

1.Dynamic Scheduling: Automatically adjust task durations in response to real-time resource
data.
2.Impact Visualisation: Display side-by-side comparisons of original and updated schedules.
3.Critical Path Insights: Clearly show the recalculated critical paths post-adjustment.
4.Scalability: The tool must handle extensive, complex schedules seamlessly.
5.Ease of Use: Ensure the tool is intuitive and requires minimal training.
Stretch Criteria:
1.Predictive Analytics: Incorporate trends to forecast future resource needs.
2.Optimization: Suggest optimisations to the schedules based on constraints and business
priorities.
3.Integration: Theorise how to integrate with other project management and reporting tools.

**Benefit**

Enhanced decision-making is achieved by providing immediate visibility into schedule
changes, allowing teams to make rapid, informed choices that minimise delays and ensure
timely interventions. The tool also increases resource efficiency by aligning schedules with
real-time availability, reducing downtime, preventing overloads, and optimising resource
utilisation across projects.
Automating rescheduling processes saves significant time, enabling teams to focus on
higher-value activities and improving overall productivity. Additionally, transparent and datadriven scheduling fosters trust among stakeholders, promoting confidence in project
timelines and deliverables.
