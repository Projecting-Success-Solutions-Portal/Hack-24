# Solution Overview

## File Directory

### **Data Processing**
1. **`XER extract.zip`**  
   - Contains CSV files extracted from an XER file.  
   - These CSVs represent structured project schedule data exported from Primavera P6.  
   - Used as input for further analysis in Power BI.  

2. **`juypiter python XER to csv extracts.JPG`**  
   - Screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook that converts XER files into CSV format.  
   - Automates data extraction to facilitate analysis in Power BI.  

3. **`notepad to define column names.JPG`**  
   - Displays column names that were **automatically** extracted from the XER file.  
   - Helps understand the structure of the processed data.  

### **Visualization & Analysis**
4. **`Project Hack - What If Analysis.pbix`**  
   - Power BI report designed for **scenario planning**.  
   - Compares available **capacity** against **planned work** to analyze workforce constraints.  
   - **Key Metrics:**  
     - Planned Work (in hours)  
     - Capacity (in days)  

5. **`Project Hack - Schedule View.pbix`**  
   - Power BI report focused on **schedule monitoring**.  
   - Uses a **Gantt Chart** to visualize project timelines.  
   - **Key Insights:**  
     - Sum of days for each task  
     - Scheduling adjustments and dependencies  
   - **Data Sources:** Extracted CSVs from the **XER extract.zip** file.
