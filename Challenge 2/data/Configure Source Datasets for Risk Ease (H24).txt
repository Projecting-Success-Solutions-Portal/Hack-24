Transform Datasets for Risk Ease (H24).pbix

This guide is to assist connecting your PBI file to the correct source dataset (250120 PDAC Hack Risk data v4.1.xlsx)

1. Get path to dataset: 250120 PDAC Hack Risk data v4.1.xlsx

* Open up Risk Ease (H24).pbix
* There may be a banner message that "There are pending changes in your queries that haven't been applied" - choose "Discard Changes" as you will be applying your own changes.
* Click Home -> Transform Data -> Transform Data [This should take you to the Transform Data Page]
* Go to D_Risks at folder: Other Queries[6]
* Go to Source step in Applied Steps (the first step)
* Change
	= Folder.Files("C:\Users\<UserName>\Downloads\Hack24")
  	to
	= Folder.Files("<Path to folder where your copy of 250120 PDAC Hack Risk data v4.1.xlsx is saved") [Note: Path to folder, not path to file]
	e.g
* Note: 250120 PDAC Hack Risk data v4.1.xlsx MUST be the most recent xlsx file in this folder

2. Update the source for every query

* Note: When updating the source make sure you are in the first Applied Step called Source. DO NOT edit steps that are not Source
* Update the sources for the following datasets
	Transform File D_Risks [2]/Helper Queries [3]/Sample File
	Transform File D_Mitigations [2]/Helper Queries [3]/Sample File (2)
	Other Queries [6]/D_Risks
	Other Queries [6]/D_Mitigations
	Other Queries [6]/F_RiskHierarchy
	Other Queries [6]/F_DateCreated
	Other Queries [6]/F_Version

When saving and refreshing the data you may get the following errors
D_Risks: 2,138 rows loaded. 881 errors.
D_Mitigations: 1,385 rows loaded. 1 error.

This is due to datatype mismatchings in the datasets and is to be expected.
If you encounter errors different from the ones above contact a member of the Hack team to provide assistance.
