# Solution Documentation

## File Directory
This project consists of the following key files:

- **Metrics & Code Development Final.xlsx** – Finalized production documentation of Python code used in the solution.
- **Metrics & Code Development.xlsx** – An earlier version of the documentation with some additional rows not present in the final version.
- **miro.com (Internet Shortcut)** – A link to the Miro board used for product decomposition.
- **Risk Ease (H24)_GRP2F_v2Final.pbix** – Power BI report for risk analysis, visualization, and financial impact tracking.

## Specific Files

### **Metrics & Code Development Final.xlsx**
- **Purpose**: Serves as the finalized documentation for the Python code used in the solution.
- **Usage**: Team members refer to this file to understand the implementation details and functions of the Python scripts.

### **Metrics & Code Development.xlsx**
- **Purpose**: An earlier iteration of the production documentation.
- **Usage**: Retained as a reference for any previous documentation that may contain additional data.

### **miro.com (Internet Shortcut)**

### **Risk Ease (H24)_GRP2F_v2Final.pbix**
- **Purpose**: Power BI report used for risk analysis and visualization.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Risk Summary**: Displays total risks, pre-factored cost, and post-factored cost.
  - **Top 5 Post-Fact Cost Risks**: Highlights high-impact financial risks.
  - **Risk Velocity & Aging**: Tracks risk resolution rates and escalation trends.
  - **Critical Risk Progression**: Shows how risks evolve and their financial impact.
  - **Impact & Likelihood Drift**: Analyzes changes in risk severity.
  - **Cost Impact vs. Prediction**: Compares actual risk costs with projected costs.
- **Data Sources & Queries**:
  - Uses **DAX Code & Power Query** to format risk data and perform calculations.
  - Implements a **custom Date Table function** (`fnDateTable`) for dynamic time-based reporting.
  - **Risk Data Transformations** ensure accurate analysis and standardized reporting.
- **Usage**: 
  - Helps project teams assess risks, track financial impact, and guide mitigation strategies.
  - Supports decision-making by identifying and prioritizing high-impact risks.
