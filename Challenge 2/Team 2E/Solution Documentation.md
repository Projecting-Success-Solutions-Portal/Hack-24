## Specific Files Documentation

### **1. Lin_Regress_Data.xlsx**
**Description:**
This file contains the **model output** from a linear regression analysis. It includes processed results derived from predictive modeling.

**Usage:**
- Used to analyze regression model results.
- May include key predictions, residuals, and evaluation metrics.

### **2. Missing_Matthew_Hack_Solution.pbix**
**Description:**
This is a **Power BI report** containing various data visualizations and insights. It does not use Power Query transformations but instead relies on **DAX calculations** for data modeling and analysis.
