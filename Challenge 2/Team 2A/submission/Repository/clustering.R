# Comments for Rosa to add to narrative
# ðŸ”´ Cluster 1: Strategic & Business-Critical Risks
# 
# These are big-picture risks that can impact the entire direction of a project. If these go wrong, the project could fail due to poor planning, weak leadership, or compliance failures.
# 
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Business Strategy & Objectives â†’ Poor planning, changing goals.
# 
# System Integration, Verification & Validation â†’ Tech systems not working together.
# 
# Project Management â†’ Poor leadership, bad coordination, missed deadlines.
# 
# Contractual/Legal â†’ Contract disputes, regulatory problems.
# 
# Hardware/Software Development â†’ Tech failures that prevent project completion.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     If a project doesnâ€™t have a strong plan, leadership, or legal foundation, it may never succeed.

#     
#     ðŸŸ  Cluster 2: Operational & Execution Risks
# 
# These risks impact the execution of a projectâ€”whether it has the right resources, people, and systems in place to succeed.
# 
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Supply Chain â†’ Delays or shortages in materials.
# 
# System Engineering â†’ Complex technical failures.
# 
# System Integration â†’ Issues when merging different components.
# 
# Acquisition & Offsets â†’ Buying the wrong resources or trade-offs.
# 
# Operations & Maintenance â†’ Problems with ongoing project upkeep.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     Even a well-planned project can fail if it doesnâ€™t have the right materials, engineering, or maintenance.
# 

#     
#     ðŸŸ¡ Cluster 3: Support & Customer-Facing Risks
# 
# These risks affect the people and processes that support the project. If these fail, the project may suffer from delays, customer complaints, or financial trouble.
# 
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Quality â†’ Defective products or unmet standards.
# 
# Logistic Support & Services â†’ Problems with staffing, transportation, and maintenance.
# 
# Customers â†’ Not meeting client needs or complaints.
# 
# Finance â†’ Budget overruns, financial mismanagement.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     A project might technically work but still fail due to poor quality, bad logistics, or financial losses.
# 

#     
#     ðŸŸ¢ Cluster 4: Business & Competitive Risks
# 
# These risks impact whether a project can be funded and remain competitive.
# 
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Bid Management â†’ Losing funding or contracts.
# 
# Other Risks & Contingencies â†’ Unexpected problems that disrupt work.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     Even if a project is well-planned and executed, it might never start if it loses funding.

#     
#     ðŸ“¢ Final Takeaways
# 
# If Cluster 1 risks are high â†’ The whole project direction and leadership is in danger.
# 
# If Cluster 2 risks are high â†’ The project might lack the right materials, engineering, or maintenance.
# 
# If Cluster 3 risks are high â†’ The project may suffer from financial problems, poor quality, or customer issues.
# 
# If Cluster 4 risks are high â†’ The project might fail to get funding or be stopped by unexpected events.
