## Challenge 2

## Challenge Name
Risk Foresight 1: Rapid Recognition and Resolution of Rising Risks

**Summary**

Managing risks effectively requires the ability to foresee challenges before they materialise.
This challenge invites participants to leverage historical risk data to design a predictive
analytics system that identifies patterns, tracks risk evolution, and forecasts emerging
vulnerabilities. By creating innovative metrics and data visualisations, teams can enable more
effective interventions and improve risk mitigation strategies.

**Pain Points**

I donâ€™t want delays in identifying risks that escalate rapidly into critical issues.
I want insight into whether mitigation efforts are effective in reducing risk exposure.
I want more clarity to forecast resource needs for risk mitigation actions.
I want to identify recurring systemic risks and emerging threats.
I want comprehensive dashboards to visualise trends in risk likelihood, impact, and
velocity.

**Personas**

As a Risk Manager, I want to understand patterns in risk escalation and mitigation, So that I
can allocate resources effectively and avoid bottlenecks.
As a Project Manager, I want clear, actionable insights into managing risks at the project
level, So that I can prevent risk recurrence and resolve issues proactively.
As a Stakeholder, I want confidence in project delivery timelines, cost, and scope through
effective risk oversight, So that I can ensure successful project outcomes with minimal
disruptions.

**Business Context**

Traditional risk management methods often focus on reactive measures. This challenge aims to shift
towards predictive and proactive approaches by integrating advanced data analytics and machine
learning techniques. Teams will need to develop key metrics to forecast risks, assess mitigation
effectiveness, and identify systemic issues, ensuring projects stay on track with minimal disruptions.
The challenge encourages the exploration of innovative metrics such as:
Risk Velocity: Measuring the speed at which risks escalate.
Resolution Rate: Evaluating the success rate of mitigating risks over time.
Emergence Rate: Identifying periods or triggers associated with new risk identification.
Likelihood and Impact Drift: Tracking shifts in project risk exposure.
Risk Clustering: Highlighting interdependent risks prone to cascading failures.
More information on potential metrics can be found in accompanying documentation

**Dataset Description**

Teams will receive a dataset comprising historical risk register entries, including attributes such as
risk identification dates, escalation timings, mitigation actions, and resolution outcomes. This data is
essential for designing a system that analyses past trends and predicts future risk dynamics.
Teams will also receive the output from the last Hackathon. The solution previous teams created has
been adapted and built upon by Thales Group and will be usable for this challenge with any sensitive
data removed.
You will also be provided a list of exploratory risk metrics to consider.

**Success Criteria**

Core Metrics Development:
Create predictive metrics that analyse historical risk patterns and forecast future trends.
Implement models to calculate metrics such as velocity, resolution rates, recurrence, and
financial impacts.
Visualisation Tools:
Develop dashboards with heatmaps, trendlines, and interactive elements to communicate
risk metrics effectively.
Ensure stakeholders can interpret data insights at a glance.
Actionable Insights:
Offer clear recommendations based on metric analysis for resource allocation, risk
prioritisation, and intervention timing.
Scalability:
Ensure the solution can be expanded to accommodate additional projects and datasets.
