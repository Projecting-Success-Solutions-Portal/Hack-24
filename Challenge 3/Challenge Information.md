## Challenge 3

## Challenge Name
Risk Foresight 2: Efficient Engagement for Exploring and Examining Risks

**Summary**

Effective risk management is vital for ensuring project delivery success. Traditionally, risks
are logged in static Risk Registers, making it difficult to extract actionable insights.
Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interrogate historical risk data can transform
how risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated.
This challenge aims to develop an AI-driven chatbot that enables natural language queries
on risk data, offering insights into historical risk trends, successful mitigations, and
predictive risk forecasting. The chatbot must integrate with the existing Power BI risk
dashboard, ensuring that insights are not only accessible but also visually represented for
better decision-making.

**Pain Points**

Critical risk insights are buried in static registers, making it difficult for stakeholders to
extract relevant information quickly.
Teams spend too much time sifting past risk data instead of focusing on proactive
mitigation.
Without AI-driven analytics, organisations struggle to identify recurring patterns and
anticipate future risks.
Stakeholders across different roles lack a centralised, chatbot-driven interface for
querying and understanding risk data.
There is no streamlined way to assess which past mitigation strategies were successful,
leading to repeated mistakes.
Current Power BI dashboards lack an interactive AI component for real-time risk analysis.

**Personas**

As a Risk Analyst, I want to quickly access historical risk trends and mitigation outcomes, So
that I can identify recurring risks and improve future strategies.
As a Project Director, I want real-time insights into emerging risks, So that I can allocate
resources effectively and keep projects on track.
As a Procurement Manager, I want to identify my supplier-related risks from past projects,
So that I can strengthen procurement strategies and prevent delays.
As a Financial Controller, I want to understand the financial impact of past risk events, So
that I can improve cost forecasting and prevent budget overruns.

**Business Context**

Organisations rely on risk registers to log potential risks and mitigation strategies. However, these
registers often function as static records rather than proactive tools. This challenge seeks to
introduce a more dynamic, AI-powered risk management system that:
Enables natural language interaction with historical risk data via an AI chatbot interface.
Uses AI to detect trends, generate recommendations, and provide predictive risk forecasts.
Seamlessly integrates with existing Power BI dashboards for enhanced visualisation and
reporting.
Provides automated alerts and risk summaries, ensuring stakeholders stay informed of significant
changes in risk data.
The goal is to create a scalable chatbot solution that proactively ingests historical risk data, allows
intuitive queries, and supports stakeholders—such as bid managers, project managers, risk analysts,
and supply chain leads—in making data-driven risk decisions.
Teams should also consider how they might collaborate with teams tackling the other risk challenge.
How would you interact and incorporate their predictive models and AI-driven forecasting into this
solution?

**Dataset Description**

Teams will receive:
A dataset comprising historical risk register entries, including risk identification dates, escalation
timings, mitigation actions, and resolution outcomes.
A set of example risk-related questions that the chatbot must accurately answer, serving as a
benchmark for evaluating response quality.
Access to the existing Power BI risk dashboard, which the chatbot must integrate with to enhance
interactive data visualisation.
Teams must design their solution to test and verify model accuracy by comparing chatbot responses
to historical risk data. Additionally, teams should assess whether responses are truly actionable in
guiding project risk management.

**Success Criteria**

For this challenge, teams will need to develop a functional AI chatbot capable of responding
to natural language risk queries using a live risk register as the source data. This solution will
need to be scalable and seamlessly integrate into current environments.
It will need to demonstrate insights such as:
Identifying recurring high-impact risks and providing historical context.
Measuring the effectiveness of past mitigation strategies and highlighting best
practices.
Providing trend analysis and predictive analytics for future risks.
Generating automated alerts and summarised risk reports for key stakeholders.
Evaluating if responses are actionable, ensuring that the insights provided can be
practically implemented.

**Benefit**

This challenge seeks to redefine risk management by shifting from a reactive to a
predictive approach. By leveraging LLMs teams will create a real-time, interactive
chatbot that transforms risk registers into an intelligent decision-making tool.
Stakeholders will be able to ask questions in natural language, receive data-driven risk
insights, and make informed decisions without manually searching through static reports.
This solution will enhance strategic planning and improve project resilience by revealing
hidden trends and ensuring actionable recommendations.
