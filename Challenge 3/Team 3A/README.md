**Solution Description**

Team 3A developed a natural language AI chatbot that seamlessly integrates with Power BI dashboards, allowing risk analysts, project managers, and stakeholders to interact with risk data dynamically. By using large language models (LLMs), the chatbot transforms static risk registers into proactive decision-making tools.
